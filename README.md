## Introduction
Rancid Tomatillos is a paired project for Module 3 that encompasses three weeks of learnings in React, Router and Cypress E2E testing. Within a twelve-day sprint, a functional movie-browsing application was constructed to simulate functionalities similar to major streaming platforms.


## Learning Goals
- Develop familiarity with React development principles.
- Employ a robust end-to-end testing suite to ensure all user flows and API calls are functioning as anticipated.
- Utilize React Router to create a multi-page UX.


## Technologies
  - React
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Cypress
  - Fetch API
  - Webpack
  - NPM
  - Router


## Features
- Upon page load, the user is presented with 40 scrollable movie posters.
- When the user clicks on a movie poster, they are taken to the details screen, where they can review the runtime, average rating and a quick overview of the film.
- The user can then return to the home page and continue browsing.
- The user is able to Utilize forward/backward arrows to navigate their history on the site, and can share specific URL to convey accurate information (specific movie details, etc.).

## Page Demo

## Possible Future Extensions
- Add functionality that would allow the user to search movies by name.
- Add functionality that would allow the user to filter movies by genre.
- Allow the user to login with their own credentials and favorite/save/review movies.
- Continue to refactor API calls, testing, etc.
